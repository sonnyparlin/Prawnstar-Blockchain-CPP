\item Set up test library, looking at boost and ctest, \href{https://www.codeguru.com/cplusplus/ten-c-testing-tools-for-developers-to-consider/}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+codeguru.\+com/cplusplus/ten-\/c-\/testing-\/tools-\/for-\/developers-\/to-\/consider/}}
\item Write tests
\item \sout{keep the blockchain stored locally using a json file.}
\item Set up mongodb as a first choice and use the json file as backup, or perhaps give the user an option between mongodb and a json file, should also find out which is faster.
\item Find all instances of json\+::parse() and put them in a try/catch block. Anytime these fail, it kills the running node.
\item Add front end for users to create wallets
\item \sout{Modify the handle\+Block\+Chain method to only send over blocks that the requesting node is missing.}
\item \sout{set new nodes to imediately request the blockchain}
\item Build or find block explorer
\item build candlestick chart
\item Integrate the liquidity pool script into transactions to determine the price at time of purchase
\item Make this documentation suite better
\item create reward transactions for forgers
\item Add security to the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_node}{Node}} API to ensure connections can only come from the current machine
